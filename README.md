# UCU-audio-spring-school-HW

This repo contains results for the second and third Homework I have done during the UCU audio spring school.

The second Homework was about alignment voice decoding from the pre-trained LSTM model.

The third Homework was about the fine-tunning Whisper model.

Code for the first homework will be added soon after some more experiments :).
